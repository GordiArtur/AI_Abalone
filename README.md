# AI_Abalone
A project

This is the main development branch. Generally here's how git flow works:
1) Create a new branch based off of the development branch
2) Code whatever you want on your own personal devevopment branch
3) Make a pull request to merge your changes onto the development branch
4) Ask a peer to review the code before merging. (DO NOT MERGE YOUR OWN CODE)

Making the pull request and asking others to do a peer review is a good way to avoid bugs.
