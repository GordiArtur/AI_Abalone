# Development Branch

This is the main development branch. Generally here's how git flow works:
1) Create a new branch based off of the development branch (Name it based off of what you are doing)
2) Code whatever you want on your own personal devevopment branch
3) Make a pull request to merge your changes onto the development branch
4) Ask a peer to review the code before merging. (DO NOT MERGE YOUR OWN CODE)

Making the pull request and asking others to do a peer review is a good way to avoid bugs. 


Git conventions:
<type of branch>/<what is being done>

bug/ general bugfixing
feat/ adding features
junk/ a throwaway branch for doing whatever you want
wip/ something that won't be done for a long time.

examples:
bug/fix-timers
feat/push-marbles-off
